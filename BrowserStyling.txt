The browser adds some minimal styling to the web page. The browser styling will be overwritten when the developer includes styling to the webpage

The styling added by the browser is not consistent across different browsers. Each browser has its own default styling.

When you create a paragraph in HTML and when you check the styling in developer tools you will observe some default style is added by the browser

p {
  display: block;
  -webkit-margin-before: 1em;
  -webkit-margin-after: 1em;
  -webkit-margin-start: 0;
  -webkit-margin-end: 0;
}

The paragraphs are added with margins. The -webkit is a prefix to represent chrome browser

a:-webkit-any-link {
  color: -webkit-link;
  text-decoration: underline;
  cursor: auto;
}

Similarly, the links will be underlined by default and will be in blue color
