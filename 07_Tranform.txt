CSS3 supports the following transformations

Translate
------
    translate(20px, 30px) -> moves the element to right by 20px and 30px down from the current position.

    translate(-40px, 20px) -> moves the element to left by 40px and 20px down from the current position.

    translate(-30px, -25px) -> moves the element to left by 30px and 25px up from the current position.


Scale
-------
    scale(2,1) -> The width of the element will be doubled and height remains the same.

    scale(0.5) -> will decrease the element size by half

    scale(1)-> element size will remain same

    scale(2)-> doubles the element size

Rotate
------
    rotate(20deg) -> Rotates the element by 20 degrees in clockwise direction.

    rotate(-50deg) -> Rotates the element by 50 degrees in anti-clockwise direction.

Skew
----
    skew(20deg) -> skew an element by 20 degrees across x-axis.

    skew(30deg, 10deg) -> skews an element by 30 degrees across x-axis and 10 degrees across y-axis.

    skewX(15deg) -> skews an element by 15 degrees across x-axis.

    skewY(45deg) -> skews an element by 45 degrees across y-axis.
